Complete the questionnaire.
Reflection on:
Your strengths identified in the questionnaire, and your approaches to stress within the workplace.
Exercise 1
• Chandra and Leonard are managers of a busy call centre, which handles inbound and outbound calls and customer complaints. Chandra works the 7 a.m.–2 p.m. shift and Leonard the 2 p.m.–9 p.m. shift. The call centre staff process up to 15 calls per hour, although the more complex customer complaints can take up to 45 minutes each to resolve. One day, Shenali, a call centre team member, receives three customer complaints in a row taking 20 minutes each to resolve. On the final one, the customer becomes abusive towards Shenali and she becomes upset, although still handles the complaint professionally. Up with her sick 3-year-old son the night before, she is feeling tired and fragile and approaches her manager Chandra to see if she can be taken ‘off the phones’ for a while. It is Friday, the centre’s busiest day, and one staff member is already off on sick leave. Chandra can see straight away that Shenali is stressed and tired. Chandra has also had a busy day of solving p代 写EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE  and Managing stress and change

Leanings forward, she asks her how things are going. Shenali fights back the tears as she refers to abusive customer. ‘You handled that extremely professionally Shenali. You kept your composure and handled the customer exactly as I would expect any other staff member to. Really, well done’ replies Chandra. Chandra sits with Shenali for another 15 minutes and asks her about her children, upcoming family holiday to Tasmania and then about what additional support could benefit the team. She then shuffles the staff around to provide Shenali with two hours of work in the back office after which Shenali returns to her usual position feeling positive about herself and her role. At 2 p.m. Leonard arrives to find the outbound call numbers are down, waiting times are averaging 90 seconds higher and customer ‘hang ups’ are up by 7%. The staff have been working extra hard to cope with the extra workload but Leonard is furious. ‘This is not the last you will hear of this; this performance will be raised in all of your upcoming performance reviews.’ By the end of his shift, the ‘numbers’ have improved. They need two of me and one less of Chandra he thinks to himself. Four staff members are absent on sick leave the following Monday.
Which do you think is the most important skill or trait that Chandra or Leonard needs to utilise in this workplace to achieve the best outcomes?
• Strong leadership such as that shown by Leonard to keep the staff on track and the achieve the best results
•  Emotional intelligence as shown by Chandra to effectively listen to and understand the staff’s needs and better support them to do their jobs
• Organisational skills to more effectively handle situations where there are staff shortages 
• Personal competence and particularly self-awareness so that they understand the impact their emotions and behaviour can have on the staff

Which do you think is the most important outcome following Chandra and Leonard’s handling of the events?
• The ripple effect in relation to the four absent staff on the Monday
• A reduction of Shenali’s stress levels
• Better relationship management between staff and management
• Worsening relationship management between staff and management
